## Overview

This directory is for all WELL DOCUMENTED notebooks one believes are worth sharing, both polished and exploratory. 
Each method has its own directory with exploratory and validation folders. Feel free to add more methods as they come about, keeping the same structure.

## Rules

- DOCUMENT DOCUMENT DOCUMENT (for the sake of others and for future you)
- Any outputs should be saved to "../scratch/output" NOT "../results/"
- Exploratory notebooks should be understandable to others (sandbox in "../scratch/", then clean, document, and move to corresponding exploratory folder)
- Validation notebooks should be reproducable and extremely well documented
- Outputs of value from validation notebooks should be saved to "../scratch/output/" then moved to appropriate directory within "../results/" with a description & short analysis in the corresponding README.md
- Validation notebooks should be of a quality that all major functions should be pushed to and called from the package (no major blocks of code)
- PLEASE document
